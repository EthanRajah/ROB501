    A simple proportional controller for IBVS.

    Implementation of a simple proportional controller for image-based
    visual servoing. The error is the difference between the desired and
    observed image plane points. Note that the number of points, n, may
    be greater than three. The x and y focal lengths in K are guaranteed 
    to be identical.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    K       - 3x3 np.array, camera intrinsic calibration matrix.
    pts_des - 2xn np.array, desired (target) image plane points.
    pts_obs - 2xn np.array, observed (current) image plane points.
    zs      - nx0 np.array, points depth values (may be estimated).
    gain    - Controller gain (lambda).

    Returns:
    --------
    v  - 6x1 np.array, desired tx, ty, tz, wx, wy, wz camera velocities.
